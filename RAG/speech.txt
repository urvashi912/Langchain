Speech on Democracy

Good morning everyone,

It is an honor to stand before you today to talk about one of the most significant pillars of human civilization – Democracy. Democracy is not just a system of governance; it is an ideal that empowers people, upholds their rights, and ensures that every individual has a voice in shaping their future.

The word democracy comes from the Greek words demos, meaning "people," and kratos, meaning "power"—together, "power of the people." It is a form of government where the citizens elect their leaders, participate in decision-making, and enjoy fundamental rights and freedoms. The essence of democracy lies in its core principles: equality, liberty, justice, and fraternity.

Democracy is not merely about casting votes during elections. It is about participation—active engagement in governance, policymaking, and societal development. It thrives on transparency, where governments are accountable to the people. A true democracy ensures that the law applies equally to all and that justice prevails without discrimination
